    <h2>Welcome to the SQL-Injection Capture-the-Flag exercises</h2>
    <p>In this problem, you will try to login as user "bob" using SQL injection, without knowing
    his password.  Bob is actually quite security savvy, so his password is a 64 character random
    alphanumeric string.  Brute-force guessing is not the way to solve this problem.</p>
